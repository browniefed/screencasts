We'll start by importing animated from react native

Next we'll create a styles variable
We'll create a stylesheet which takes an object and a named style
we'll call ours container
then we'll add styles to this container
and we'll give it the flex 1 property to take up all available space
the align items style with the property of center
and justify content style with the property of center as well

then we'll apply our style to our view
by giving it the style property and passing it styles.container

now we'll add an animated view child
by opening our view container and then reclosing it

then creating Animated.View tag

We'll create then a style for our animated view called animated
with the background color of 3's
A width of 100
And a height of 100

Then we'll apply to the style to our Animated.View

Refresh our emulator
and see we now have a square on the screen

Now we'll create a component will mount life cycle method
Then we'll create an instance variable by typing this.animatedOpacityValue
Equals
a new Animated.Value which will create a new instance of an animated Value
Which takes a starting value which we'll pass in 1

Then we'll create a style variable 
Which will be an object
With a opacity style and we'll give it this.animatedOpacityValue
Which will be our animated value
 
Now we'll apply both styles to our animated view
by passing in an array
And the inline style that we've created

We can refresh the emulator and see that it still has an opacity of 1

Now we'll create a component did mount lifecycle method
and use Animated.timing which is a function
That takes 2 arguments
The first is the animated value that we want to animate
The second is a configuration object
For animated.timing it has 2 primary options
The First is ToValue which is the value that we want to animate to
And we'll pass in .3
And the second is the duration which we'll pass in 1000 milliseconds

Then we can call start on our animated.timing to start the animation

Now when we refresh our emulator
You can see animated.timing animated our opacity from 1 to .3 over 1 second
